Download the Email spam dataset from the link given below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somesh24/spambase
The “spam” concept is diverse: advertisements for products/websites, make money fast schemes, chain 
letters, pornography. Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had 
filed spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence 
the word „george‟ and the area code „650‟ are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when 
constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get 
a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.
Develop a python program to classify Emails as Spam or Ham using Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Model. Visualize the features from the dataset and interpret the results obtained by the model using Matplotlib library
