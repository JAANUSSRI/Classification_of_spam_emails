## Classification_of_spam_emails using SVM
Download the Email spam dataset from the link given below:

The “spam” concept is diverse: advertisements for products/websites, make money fast schemes, chain 
letters, pornography. Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had 
filed spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence 
the word „george‟ and the area code „650‟ are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when 
constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

Develop a python program to classify Emails as Spam or Ham using Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Model. Visualize the features from the dataset and interpret the results obtained by the model using Matplotlib library

This implementation provides a comprehensive analysis of SVM models with different kernel functions for email spam classification and helps in understanding which kernel function performs best for this task.

**INFERENCE:**

We infer the effectiveness of using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with different kernel functions in classifying emails as spam or ham.

**Comparison of Results:**

•	We compared the training and test accuracies as well as confusion matrices for different kernel functions.
•	We observed that the linear kernel achieved the highest test accuracy in this scenario.

**Best Kernel:**

•	We identified the best kernel based on test accuracy.
•	In this case, the linear kernel performed the best.
